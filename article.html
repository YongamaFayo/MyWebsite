        <div class="article">
            <p>
            

                Every web performance story is similar, isn’t it? It always starts with the long-awaited website
                overhaul. A
                day when a project, fully polished and carefully optimized, gets launched, ranking high and soaring
                above
                performance scores in Lighthouse and WebPageTest. There is a celebration and a wholehearted sense of
                accomplishment prevailing in the air — beautifully reflected in retweets and comments and
                newsletters and
                Slack threads.

                Yet as time passes by, the excitement slowly fades away, and urgent adjustments, much-needed
                features, and
                new business requirements creep in. And suddenly, before you know it, the code base gets a little
                bit
                overweight and fragmented, third-party scripts have to load just a little bit earlier, and shiny new
                dynamic
                content finds its way into the DOM through the backdoors of fourth-party scripts and their uninvited
                guests.

                We’ve been there at Smashing as well. Not many people know it but we are a very small team of around
                12
                people, many of whom are working part-time and most of whom are usually wearing many different hats
                on a
                given day. While performance has been our goal for almost a decade now, we never really had a
                dedicated
                performance team.


                <section><img src="./images/stats.png" alt=""></section>

                <i>This is where we started. With Lighthouse scores being somewhere between 40 and 60, we decided to
                    tackle
                    performance (yet again) heads on. (Image source: Lighthouse Metrics) (Large preview)</i>

                <div class="comment">As it happened, we lost track of performance in the busyness of day-to-day routine.
                    We were
                    designing and building things, setting up new products, refactoring the components, and publishing
                    articles.
                    So by late 2020, things got a bit out of control, with yellowish-red Lighthouse scores slowly
                    showing up
                    across the board. We had to fix that.</div>

                <h2>That’s Where We Were</h2>
                <br>
                <br>

                <div class="article">

                    Some of you might know that we are running on JAMStack, with all articles and pages stored as
                    Markdown
                    files, Sass files compiled into CSS, JavaScript split into chunks with Webpack and Hugo building out
                    static
                    pages that we then serve directly from an Edge CDN. Back in 2017 we built the entire site with
                    Preact, but
                    then have moved to React in 2019 — and use it along with a few APIs for search, comments,
                    authentication and
                    checkout.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The entire site is built with progressive enhancement in mind, meaning that you, dear reader, can
                    read every
                    Smashing article in its entirety without the need to boot the application at all. It’s not very
                    surprising
                    either — in the end, a published article doesn’t change much over the years, while dynamic pieces
                    such as
                    Membership authentication and checkout need the application to run.
                    The entire build for deploying around 2500 articles live takes around 6 mins at the moment. The
                    build
                    process on its own has become quite a beast over time as well, with critical CSS injects, Webpack’s
                    code
                    splitting, dynamic inserts of advertising and feature panels, RSS (re)generation, and eventual A/B
                    testing
                    on the edge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In early 2020, we’ve started with the big refactoring of the CSS layout components. We never used
                    CSS-in-JS
                    or styled-components, but instead a good ol’ component-based system of Sass-modules which would be
                    compiled
                    into CSS. Back in 2017, the entire layout was built with Flexbox and rebuilt with CSS Grid and CSS
                    Custom
                    Properties in mid-2019. However, some pages needed special treatment due to new advertising spots
                    and new
                    product panels. So while the layout was working, it wasn’t working very well, and it was quite
                    difficult to
                    maintain.
                    Additionally, the header with the main navigation had to change to accommodate for more items that
                    we wanted
                    to display dynamically. Plus, we wanted to refactor some frequently used components used across the
                    site,
                    and the CSS used there needed some revision as well — the newsletter box being the most notable
                    culprit. We
                    started off by refactoring some components with utility-first CSS but we never got to the point that
                    it was
                    used consistently across the entire site.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The larger issue was the large JavaScript bundle that — not very surprisingly — was blocking the
                    main-thread
                    for hundreds of milliseconds. A big JavaScript bundle might seem out of place on a magazine that
                    merely
                    publishes articles, but actually, there is plenty of scripting happening behind the scenes.
                    We have various states of components for authenticated and unauthenticated customers. Once you are
                    signed
                    in, we want to show all products in the final price, and as you add a book to the cart, we want to
                    keep a
                    cart accessible with a tap on a button — no matter what page you are on. Advertising needs to come
                    in
                    quickly without causing disruptive layout shifts, and the same goes for the native product panels
                    that
                    highlight our products. Plus a service worker that caches all static assets and serves them for
                    repeat
                    views, along with cached versions of articles that a reader has already visited.
                    So all of this scripting had to happen at some point, and it was draining on the reading experience
                    even
                    although the script was coming in quite late. Frankly, we were painstakingly working on the site and
                    new
                    components without keeping a close eye on performance (and we had a few other things to keep in mind
                    for
                    2020). 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The turning point came unexpectedly. Harry Roberts ran his (excellent) Web Performance
                    Masterclass as
                    an online workshop with us, and throughout the entire workshop, he was using Smashing as an example
                    by
                    highlighting issues that we had and suggesting solutions to those issues alongside useful tools and
                    guidelines.
                    Throughout the workshop, I was diligently taking notes and revisiting the codebase. At the time of
                    the
                    workshop, our Lighthouse scores were 60–68 on the homepage, and around 40-60 on article pages — and
                    obviously worse on mobile. Once the workshop was over, we got to work.
                    Identifying The Bottlenecks
                    We often tend to rely on particular scores to get an understanding of how well we perform, yet too
                    often
                    single scores don’t provide a full picture. As David East eloquently noted in his article, web
                    performance
                    isn’t a single value; it’s a distribution. Even if a web experience is heavily and thoroughly an
                    optimized
                    all-around performance, it can’t be just fast. It might be fast to some visitors, but ultimately it
                    will
                    also be slower (or slow) to some others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reasons for it are numerous, but the most important one is a huge difference in network
                    conditions and
                    device hardware across the world. More often than not we can’t really influence those things, so we
                    have to
                    ensure that our experience accommodates them instead.
                    In essence, our job then is to increase the proportion of snappy experiences and decrease the
                    proportion of
                    sluggish experiences. But for that, we need to get a proper picture of what the distribution
                    actually is.
                    Now, analytics tools and performance monitoring tools will provide this data when needed, but we
                    looked
                    specifically into CrUX, Chrome User Experience Report. CrUX generates an overview of performance
                    distributions over time, with traffic collected from Chrome users. Much of this data related to Core
                    Web
                    Vitals which Google has announced back in 2020, and which also contribute to and are exposed in
                    Lighthouse.
